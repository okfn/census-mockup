                      <p>Since 2009 the Brazilian Federal Institute for Geography and Statistics realizes regular research about economic activity on a monthly base. Data is available for different economic activities and per state. Every ten years the institute realizes a demographic census. Data can be accessed via online services: <a href="http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/">http://www.sidra.ibge.gov.br/</a>, is presented in time series: <a href="http://seriesestatisticas.ibge.gov.br/lista_tema.aspx?op=0&amp;no=8">http://seriesestatisticas.ibge.gov.br/lista_tema.aspx?op=0&amp;no=8</a> or can be downloaded: <a href="http://downloads.ibge.gov.br/downloads_estatisticas.htm">http://downloads.ibge.gov.br/downloads_estatisticas.htm</a></p>
<p>Statistics are also provided by the federal Institute of Applied Economic Research (IPEA), many of which are reproduced from another source. Some series are regularly updated, others are not. Licensing information is similar to CC-BY, allowing copying and reuse but requiring attibution. So it should be considered open. Data is not linkable to, as the machine-readable versions (csv or Excel) require clicking an "export" button on the interface, and there is no direct access URL for the files.</p>

Tabular data is generally provided in machine-readable formats such as Excel (an open format such as CSV would be preferable but we still consider this acceptable). The data is also available "in bulk" in the sense that ther e are complete files plus data is available via automated access on an FTP site at <a href="http://www2.census.gov/">http://www2.census.gov/</a> (where CSV files are often available). One point to note is that there are other sources of such data within the US government including the Bureau of Economic Analysis (<a href="http://bea.gov">http://bea.gov</a>), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (<a href="http://bls.gov/">http://bls.gov/</a>) etc. </p>

At <a href="http://www.govdata.de">http://www.govdata.de</a> the same data is available under the German "Datenlizenz Deutschland" which has been reviewed and considered not compliant with the Open Definition in Version 1.0. However, this non-compliance was due to the fact that there is the option to apply the Datenlizenz Deutschland with an NC component. However, non of the data sets on govdata.de published by the National Statistics Agency carry the NC component. Thereby the data is openly licensed. Furthermore the Datenlizenz 2.0 has been approved by the Open Definition Advisory Council recently and it can be assumed that it will replace the 1,0 version shortly to erase and ambiguities about openness.</p>

<p>There are many kinds of demographic data.  Statistical data are also available from many federal agencies and they are released intermittently. Administrative health data are available from the Canadian Institute of Health Information (CIHI). Health, education and so on are administered by provinces and territories and these are available by contacting all 13 jurisdictions. Revenue data are available from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) while housing data are available from the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). Unemployment and bankruptcy data are available from Human Resources and Development Services Canada (HRSDC), immigration from Citizen Immigration Canada, and so on. Some data are for fee, some are for free, some are difficult to find as there is no central repository, many of the agencies are not well organized and not all are in the open data portal. Also some of these are administrative data while others are official national statistics.</p>

<p>Sakstat / Geostat provides foundational statistics for free, such as population, GDP, unemployment, etc. However, the agency collects more detailed statistics which are not freely available. The freely-available statistics are sufficiently detailed that I believe the dataset qualifies as freely available even though not all statistics collected by the agency are available for free.</p>
<p>All government-generated data in Georgia is legally in the public domain.</p>

                      <p>The CAPMAS (Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics) is the national authority responsible for collecting, curating and releasing the country's data on demographics, wages, agriculture, tourism, etc. The website and the data are available in Arabic and English.</p>
<p>Majority of are in PDF format, but some others are in XLS. There are also some broken links on the website.</p>
<p>Final reviewer: The majority of information is available as PDF embedded in a flash reader. The data overall is available in a non-readable format and is not available in bulk. Yet these criteria were marked as 'unsure' since one can filter and download quite some data through the CensusInfo database, incl. in a machine-readable format. </p>
<p>Regarding the timeliness of data, it is marked as outdated:
<a href="http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/">http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/</a> and <a href="http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/DIWizard/DIWizardHome.aspx">http://www.censusinfo.capmas.gov.eg/DivInfo/DIWizard/DIWizardHome.aspx</a> are the CAPMAS database; they seem to provided data from either 1980 or 2012 (unclear). Indeed, some summary numbers are provided for 2014 (e.g., <a href="http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pepo/lab_e.pdf">http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pepo/lab_e.pdf</a>). Lastly, it is unknown what the release mechanism is and how often the data is updated.</p>
<p>QA reviewer comment - different data can be downloaded in XLS and in bulk, as seen in the link here- <a href="http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pages/IndicatorsPage.aspx?Ind_id=1104">http://www.capmas.gov.eg/Pages/IndicatorsPage.aspx?Ind_id=1104</a></p>
<p>Data however, is not timely updated.</p>

                      <p>The Kenya National Bureau of statistics which is the central government agency that collects data has statistics on census, economic activities, demographics. It has many channels through which the some of the data is distributed, with links for these pages on their website, one of which is the Kenya Open Data Initiative (KODI). However there seems to be no standard for distributing data. Some are available and open e.g. KODI but some are available on the KNBS website itself but not open. Some of these are not charged while others are. KNBS applies a statistics act and a form has to be submitted for data requests. On the plus side some include metadata, background information, data description. On the Kenya Open Data portal, the datasets are mostly from KNBS but not up to date.
[According to Ahmed ]</p>
<p>Other areas i.e. Consumer Price Indices have regularly updated data within the site, the Statistics section has data between 2006 and 2012 which is pretty outdated at present.</p>

<li>the metadata displayed for the data in an open data portal or web page</li>
<li>the dataset title or filename e.g. Budget 2013-14 or Election_4July2015.csv</li>
<li>metadata tags embedded in the web page that contains the data</li>
<li>date values within the data to find the most recent date value</li>
<li>the timestamp on the data file (although this may not be accurate)</li>
<li>Some data is not updated on a regular basis. e.g. Pollutant emissions may be updated daily - while postal codes may not change for many years. </li>
</ul>

                      <p>The Ministry of Development Planning and Statistics publishes a variety of statistics on its website including population, GDP, and unemployment. However, this data is scattered over many different pages, For example, the latest key indicators for all statistics can be viewed on this page ( <a href="http://www.gsdp.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/statistics_en/key_indicators_en">http://www.gsdp.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/statistics_en/key_indicators_en</a> ), while the archival monthly and annual reports are available on separate pages and much more difficult to find. Some data appears to be very up to date, such as population ( <a href="http://www.mdps.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/statistics_en/monthly_preliminary_figures_on_population_en">http://www.mdps.gov.qa/portal/page/portal/gsdp_en/statistics_en/monthly_preliminary_figures_on_population_en</a> ), but for other topics they appear to be published many months ago ( such as those in they key indicators page ).  </p>
<p>Qatar also has a data portal ( <a href="http://www.qalm.gov.qa/">http://www.qalm.gov.qa/</a> ), but it appears to be extremely out of date and very buggy.</p>

<p>The question about licensing is tricky to answer: when it boils down to the HCP, the data and content it provides are property of the institution. The Open Data portal has an unclear status: each dataset here is individually licensed under the ODbL yet the website itself and all its content are copyrighted by the eGov unit (data.gov.ma has no indication whatsoever on its 'License' page: <a href="http://www.data.gov.ma/fr/licence">http://www.data.gov.ma/fr/licence</a>). Thus, the copyright mention has priority and the data is considered non-open.</p>
